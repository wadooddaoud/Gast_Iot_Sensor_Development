Description: Adafruit Python DHT Sensor Library
        ==================================
        
        Python library to read the DHT series of humidity and temperature sensors on a Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black.
        
        Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit DHT series sensors ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/385
        
        Currently the library is tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4. It should work with Python greater than 3.4, too.
        
        For all platforms (Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black) make sure your system is able to compile Python extensions.  On Raspbian or Beaglebone Black's Debian/Ubuntu image you can ensure your system is ready by executing:
        
        ````
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev
        ````
        
        Install the library by downloading with the download link on the right, unzipping the archive, and executing:
        
        ````
        sudo python setup.py install
        ````
        You can ommit the sudo if you use raspberry pi.
        
        See example of usage in the examples folder.
